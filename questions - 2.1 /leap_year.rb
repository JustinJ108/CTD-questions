# (4) Write a program, leap_year.rb. It will ask the user for a starting year and an ending year, 
# and it will then print out all the leap years between them, including the starting or ending year 
# if those are leap years. The rules for leap years are: A leap year is divisible by 4, except for years 
# that are divisible by 100 -- those aren't leap years -- except for years that are divisible by 400, which 
# ARE leap years.


print "please enter starting year"
answer = gets.chomp
print "please enter final year"
answer2 = gets.chomp

# put in array

2022

define leap year

if (num % 4 == 0) && (num >= answer2 || num <= answer)
    

puts answer + answer

def leap_year()

    if number > answer && number < answer2
